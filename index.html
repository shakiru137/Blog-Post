        <h2>Personal Story</h2>
        <p>
          I’ve always been passionate about financial technology and the impact
          it can have on improving people's financial health. Growing up, I
          witnessed my parents struggle with managing their finances due to
          limited resources and knowledge. This inspired me to create Pure Bank,
          aiming to provide a user-friendly platform that simplifies financial
          management for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working on this project reminded me of the challenges my parents faced
          and motivated me to develop solutions that can make a difference. My
          goal was to make financial services more accessible and secure,
          helping others achieve better financial stability and confidence.

        <h2>Most Difficult Technical Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most challenging technical aspects of this project was
          implementing secure user authentication. Here’s how I tackled it:
        </p>
        <p>
          Situation: Early in the project, I decided to implement secure
          authentication for user accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Task: The task was to integrate secure password hashing and
          validation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Action: I researched various authentication methods and chose Flask's
          built-in authentication system. However, I encountered issues with the
          password hashing mechanism not working as expected. After seeking help
          from the Flask community, I discovered that the PASSWORD_HASHING
          setting needed proper configuration. I meticulously followed the
          advice and examples provided by the community, ensuring that every
          detail was correctly implemented.
        </p>
        <p>
          Result: After implementing the solution, the authentication system
          worked perfectly, ensuring user passwords were securely hashed and
          validated, providing the necessary security for our users' data.
        </p>

      <section id="lessons-learned">
        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <h3>Technical Takeaways</h3>
        <p>
          Deepened my understanding of Flask's authentication system and best
          practices for securing user data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Improved my skills in troubleshooting and seeking help from the
          developer community.
        </p>

        <h3>What I Might Do Differently</h3>
        <p>
          I would plan more thoroughly for potential technical challenges to
          avoid last-minute issues. Proactive research and early testing could
          have saved time and reduced stress.
        </p>

        <h3>Personal Growth</h3>
        <p>
          This project taught me the importance of persistence and leveraging
          community support when facing technical hurdles. I am now more
          confident in my skills as a full-stack developer.
        </p>

        <h3>Future Path</h3>
        <p>
          This experience has solidified my interest in financial technology and
          web development. I am excited to tackle more complex projects in the
          future, with a stronger focus on security and user experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Confirmed or Questioned Beliefs</h3>
        <p>
          I realized the power and flexibility of Flask for web development,
          confirming my preference for using it in future projects.
